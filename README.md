# RichLogger

A simple Logger for Python which includes rich formatting for console prints.

# Idea

The idea is to have this logging class to do the heavy lifting to initialize the python logging module and support printing to the console.
If logging to a file is not necessary the library can be used in the same way, by simply printing to the console or do nothing.
